Thunderbeam-Lightbeam for Chrome is a Google Chrome extension that uses interactive visualizations to show relationships under third parties.
- Thunderbeam starts recording connections as soon as it's installed.

- To start visualizing your online interactions, open a new tab, navigate to a site, and then check back to the Thunderbeam tab.

- Thunderbeam is used for our research study. If you consent, and only if you consent, your browser data will be used for research. Please note that even for those who consent, no personal data belonging to the users will be used (and data is hashed to prevent re-identification); any data collected will be used only for the purposes of non-commercial research, and all data will be deleted after the research project completes.
